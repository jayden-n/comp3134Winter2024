What I see in the browser is:

Warning:  scandir(hello): Failed to open directory: No such file or directory in /var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php on line 7
Warning:  scandir(): (errno 2): No such file or directory in /var/www/html/directory_traversal_part1.php on line 7

you can see the directories listed there, also the directory hello doesn't exists so that's why the warning.
