• What is the definition of server port?

A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.
All network-connected devices come equipped with standardized ports that have an assigned number. These numbers are reserved for certain protocols
and their associated function. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages, for example, always go to port 80 -- one of the most commonly used ports.
